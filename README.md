OrbitOPL Toolbox – A modern, cross-platform way to manage your OPL game collection.

# 📖 About

OrbitOPL Toolbox is an open-source and cross-platform application for organizing your PlayStation 2 game library.

It was created to fill the gap left by OPLManager, which lacks macOS and Linux support.
The goal isn’t to replace OPLManager, but to offer an alternative, one that’s modern, intuitive, and built with technologies familiar to JavaScript developers.

# ✨ Features

## ✅ Current

- Cross-Platform: Windows, macOS, and Linux support
- Reading ISO Games in Library
- Importing ISO Games with Auto-Discovery + Artwork fetching
- Modern UI: Built with Electron for a clean, user-friendly experience
- Artwork download: on single game or full library fetch

## 🚧 Roadmap

### Short Term

- Multiple game imports
- .bin/.cue auto conversion to .iso during import
- Search & filter games

### Long Term

- PS1 and APPS support
- Cheats management
- CFG support (TBD)
- Additional community-requested features

📝 The roadmap evolves based on feedback and development priorities.
