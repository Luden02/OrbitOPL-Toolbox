OpenOPLToolbox is an open-source and cross-platform way to manage your OPL game collection.

This project was born from a lack of support of OPLManager for macOS and Linux operating systems, so I decided to give the community a more modern and better-supported way of handling their OPL library.

This project does not aim to replace OPLManager and never willâ€”it's just another way of doing things that some people might prefer.

Electron and React were used to make development and maintenance of the codebase much faster and easily readable by developers skilled in JavaScript who might want to contribute and to make it visually pleasing in a way.
